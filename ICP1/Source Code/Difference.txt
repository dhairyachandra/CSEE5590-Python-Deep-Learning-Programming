Ques. State differences between Python 2 and Python 3 version.

Ans. Print is treated differently between the two versions. Print is a statement in version 2.
while it is a function in version 3. This affects the way that information to be printed is passed.

Version 2 treats integers differently as version 3. In version 2, numbers entered without digits after
A decimal point are considered integers. This led to problems when doing division. 5/2 would be 2 in version 2.
To get 2.5, 5.0/2.0 needs to be typed plus instruct the answer to be returned as float.
For version 3, 5/2 is 2.5 default.

In previous version of Python, variables that are iterated over in a list comprehension and
global variables that share the same name can cause the global variable to be changed which is not something
that is desired. Python 3 fixes this.

Version 3 stores strings as unicode by default. Version 2 did not do this.

Version 2 and version 3 also have some different syntax for different things like raising errors.
